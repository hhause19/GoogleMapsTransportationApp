# GoogleMapsTransportationApp
google maps transportation planning app using the google maps API


This project was started from scratch for a client who was looking to use the Google Maps API to plan new bus routes for his transportation consulting service. The current functionality includes allowing the user to place multiple pins on the map (representing the bus stops) and then the program will calculate the total distance as a result.

The next step will be to add fix a bug where when a pin in a current route is dragged to a new point and then a subsequent pin is added, the pin that has been dragged will return to its original spot. The goal is to keep it at the updated location. 

Another goal is to add a database that will allow the user to save the route that has been made in a session and pull up the same route in the future.
